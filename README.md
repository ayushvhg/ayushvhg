Scope:

3D virtual exploration of AYUSH medicinal plants.
AI-driven plant identification and wellness guidance (herbs, yoga).
Herbal tea module and QR code generation for easy sharing.
Accessibility features: voice search, TTS, multilingual support.
Future scope: AR integration, expert consultations, expanded database.

Methodology:

Agile Development ‚Äî 12 weeks, 6 sprints.


Sprint 1: Core system setup, AI plant identification using EfficientNet & ResNet.

Sprint 2: 3D Virtual Tour & Plant Info (A-Frame).

Sprint 3: Herbal Medicine & Yoga Pose Recommendation Module.

üìö Literature Review Summary:
Kavitha et al. (2023)
Developed a MobileNet-based real-time medicinal plant identification system (6 species). Achieved 98.33% accuracy but limited to 6 species and highly dependent on image quality.
Ambarwari et al. (2020)
Used leaf venation features + SVM for plant identification. Accuracy: 82.67%. Limited by image conditions and complex preprocessing.
Azadnia et al. (2022)
Proposed a CNN-based model for leaf identification across 5 species, achieving 99.3% accuracy using multi-resolution testing.
Vanmore et al. (2024)
Introduced a Virtual Herbal Garden platform combining 3D models, plant data, and multimedia. Future scope includes AR, VR, and AI-enhanced search.
Prasvita & Herdiyeni
Created MedLeaf Android App using LBPV + PNN. Accuracy: 56.33%. Faced challenges with similar textures and low-quality images.

üí° Existing System Overview:
Virtual Herbal Garden:
Web platform (HTML, CSS, JS, Node.js, MongoDB) for learning AYUSH medicinal plants through text & multimedia, but lacks 3D/VR interactivity and advanced features.
MobileNet-based Real-Time Identification:
Focused on 6 plant species, trained with ~3,000 images, achieved 98.33% accuracy but limited scalability, narrow species coverage, and cloud-dependency.

‚ö° Limitations of Existing Systems:
Limited Accessibility:
Physical gardens & expert knowledge are hard to access; systems lack offline usability and multi-language support.
Scalability Issues:
Existing models handle a limited number of species and struggle with database expansion.
Lack of Engagement:
Minimal interactivity; limited VR/AR, multimedia, personalized learning.
Insufficient AYUSH Context:
Lack of remedy recommendations, yoga suggestions, or holistic health guidance.

üîç Gap Analysis:
Current systems focus mainly on basic plant identification without AYUSH-specific insights, holistic health recommendations, 3D immersion, accessibility tools, or scalability.
AI-based identification (EfficientNet + ResNet for 30 species).
3D Virtual Garden (A-Frame).
Personalized herbal medicine & yoga recommendations.
Voice search, text-to-speech, QR code, herbal tea module & multi-language support.

üåø Relevance of the Project:
Aligns with rising global interest in natural remedies and AYUSH-based healthcare.
Empowers students, practitioners, and enthusiasts through accessible, engaging, and immersive learning.
Promotes cultural preservation of Indian traditional medicine via modern technology.
Bridges the gap between traditional wisdom and AI-driven digital solutions.
Supports health education and integration of alternative medicine in modern healthcare.
