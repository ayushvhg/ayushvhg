Developed a MobileNet-based real-time medicinal plant identification system (6 species). Achieved 98.33% accuracy but limited to 6 species and highly dependent on image quality.

Ambarwari et al. (2020)

Used leaf venation features + SVM for plant identification. Accuracy: 82.67%. Limited by image conditions and complex preprocessing.

Azadnia et al. (2022)

Proposed a CNN-based model for leaf identification across 5 species, achieving 99.3% accuracy using multi-resolution testing.

Vanmore et al. (2024)

Introduced a Virtual Herbal Garden platform combining 3D models, plant data, and multimedia. Future scope includes AR, VR, and AI-enhanced search.

Prasvita & Herdiyeni

Created MedLeaf Android App using LBPV + PNN. Accuracy: 56.33%. Faced challenges with similar textures and low-quality images.
